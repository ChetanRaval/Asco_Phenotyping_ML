  abstract = {High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) platforms are capable of monitoring the phenotypic variation of plants through multiple types of sensors, such as red green and blue (RGB) cameras, hyperspectral sensors, and computed tomography, which can be associated with environmental and genotypic data. Because of the wide range of information provided, HTP datasets represent a valuable asset to characterize crop phenotypes. As HTP becomes widely employed with more tools and data being released, it is important that researchers are aware of these resources and how they can be applied to accelerate crop improvement. Researchers may exploit these datasets either for phenotype comparison or employ them as a benchmark to assess tool performance and to support the development of tools that are better at generalizing between different crops and environments. In this review, we describe the use of image-based HTP for yield prediction, root phenotyping, development of climate-resilient crops, detecting pathogen and pest infestation, and quantitative trait measurement. We emphasize the need for researchers to share phenotypic data, and offer a comprehensive list of available datasets to assist crop breeders and tool developers to leverage these resources in order to accelerate crop breeding., Various approaches are used to analyze high-throughput phenotyping data and tools can be developed and assessed using available image-based datasets.},

  abstract = {During the last decade, there has been rapid adoption of ground and aerial platforms with multiple sensors for phenotyping various biotic and abiotic stresses throughout the developmental stages of the crop plant. High throughput phenotyping (HTP) involves the application of these tools to phenotype the plants and can vary from ground-based imaging to aerial phenotyping to remote sensing. Adoption of these HTP tools has tried to reduce the phenotyping bottleneck in breeding programs and help to increase the pace of genetic gain. More specifically, several root phenotyping tools are discussed to study the plant’s hidden half and an area long neglected. However, the use of these HTP technologies produces big data sets that impede the inference from those datasets. Machine learning and deep learning provide an alternative opportunity for the extraction of useful information for making conclusions. These are interdisciplinary approaches for data analysis using probability, statistics, classification, regression, decision theory, data visualization, and neural networks to relate information extracted with the phenotypes obtained. These techniques use feature extraction, identification, classification, and prediction criteria to identify pertinent data for use in plant breeding and pathology activities. This review focuses on the recent findings where machine learning and deep learning approaches have been used for plant stress phenotyping with data being collected using various HTP platforms. We have provided a comprehensive overview of different machine learning and deep learning tools available with their potential advantages and pitfalls. Overall, this review provides an avenue for studying various HTP platforms with particular emphasis on using the machine learning and deep learning tools for drawing legitimate conclusions. Finally, we propose the conceptual challenges being faced and provide insights on future perspectives for managing those issues.},

  abstract = {Manual measurements of quantitative traits are time consuming and error prone. Therefore, high-throughput phenotyping methods that allow a rapid and accurate assessment are vital to a growing range of researchers such as agronomists, breeders, phytopathologists, geneticists, ecologists and biologists. Here, I describe the pliman R package, a collection of functions designed (but not limited) to conduct plant image analysis. The package will help researchers to (a) manipulate, segment and compute image indexes based on Red, Green, Blue, Red-Edge and Near-Infrared bands; (b) measure leaf area and shape; (c) quantify plant disease severity; (d) count and extract features (e.g. area, perimeter, radius, circularity and eccentricity) of objects such as grains, leaves, pods, pollen and cells; and (e) compute RGB indexes for each object in an image. In this paper, I describe the main features implemented in the package, guiding the user along a gentle learning curve with practical and reproducible examples. The results of validation studies implemented to count objects in different scenarios (combination of seed sizes, background colour and image resolution), measure leaf area, and quantify plant disease severity have shown that pliman measurements are highly concordant with existing ‘gold standard’ tools. The pliman package offers a flexible, intuitive and richly documented working environment for image-based phenotyping, being an interesting alternative to free and commercial ‘point-and-click’ solutions. R users will find the package fairly easy to use and will be surprised at how the setting of a few arguments will allow processing thousands of images while they enjoy a cup of coffee.},

  abstract = {Studies in plant pathology, agronomy, and plant breeding requiring disease severity assessment often use quantitative ordinal scales (i.e., a special type of ordinal scale that uses defined numeric ranges); a frequently used example of such a scale is the Horsfall-Barratt scale. Parametric proportional odds models (POMs) may be used to analyze the ratings obtained from quantitative ordinal scales directly, without converting ratings to percent area affected using range midpoints of such scales (currently a standard procedure). Our aim was to evaluate the performance of the POM for comparing treatments using ordinal estimates of disease severity relative to two alternatives, the midpoint conversions (MCs) and nearest percent estimates (NPEs). A simulation method was implemented and the parameters of the simulation estimated using actual disease severity data from the field. The criterion for comparison of the three approaches was the power of the hypothesis test (the probability to reject the null hypothesis when it is false). Most often, NPEs had superior performance. The performance of the POM was never inferior to using the MC at severity {$<$}40\%. Especially at low disease severity (≤10\%), the POM was superior to using the MC method. Thus, for early onset of disease or for comparing treatments with severities {$<$}40\%, the POM is preferable for analyzing disease severity data based on quantitative ordinal scales when comparing treatments and at severities {$>$}40\% is equivalent to other methods.},

These tools include multivariate analysis of disease dynamics involving principal component analysis, cluster analysis, factor analysis, pattern analysis, discriminant analysis, multivariate analysis of variance, correspondence analysis, canonical correlation analysis, redundancy analysis, genetic diversity analysis, and stability analysis, which involve in joint regression, additive main effects and multiplicative interactions, and genotype-by-environment interaction biplot analysis. The advanced statistical tools, such as non-parametric analysis of disease association, meta-analysis, Bayesian analysis, and decision theory, take an important place in analysis of disease dynamics. Disease forecasting methods by simulation models for plant diseases have a great potentiality in practical disease control strategies. Common mathematical tools such as monomolecular, exponential, logistic, Gompertz and linked differential equations take an important place in growth curve analysis of disease epidemics. The highly informative means of displaying a range of numerical data through construction of box and whisker plots has been suggested. The probable applications of recent advanced tools of linear and non-linear mixed models like the linear mixed model, generalized linear model, and generalized linear mixed models have been presented. The most recent technologies such as micro-array analysis, though cost effective, provide estimates of gene expressions for thousands of genes simultaneously and need attention by the molecular biologists. Some of these advanced tools can be well applied in different branches of rice research, including crop improvement, crop production, crop protection, social sciences as well as agricultural engineering. The rice research scientists should take advantage of these new opportunities adequately in adoption of the new highly potential advanced technologies while planning experimental designs, data collection, analysis and interpretation of their research data sets.},

This study was conducted to better understand the risk posed by the Australian A. rabiei population to current resistance sources and to provide informed decision support for chemical control strategies. Recent changes in the pathogenicity of the population were proposed based on disease severity and histopathological observations on a host set. Controlled environment disease screening of 201 isolates on the host set revealed distinct pathogenicity groups, with 41\% of all isolates assessed as highly aggressive and a significant increase in the proportion of isolates able to cause severe damage on resistant and moderately resistant cultivars since 2013. In particular, the frequency of highly aggressive isolates on the widely adopted PBA HatTrick cultivar rose from 18\% in 2013 to 68\% in 2017. In addition, isolates collected since 2016 caused severe disease on Genesis 090, another widely adopted moderately resistant cultivar and on ICC3996, a commonly used resistance source. Of immediate concern was the 10\% of highly aggressive isolates able to severely damage the recently released resistant cultivar PBA Seamer (2016). Histopathology studies revealed that the most aggressive isolates were able to germinate, develop appressoria and invade directly through the epidermis faster than lower aggressive isolates on all hosts assessed, including ICC3996. The fungal invasion triggered a common reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hypersensitive response (HR) on all assessed resistant genotypes with initial biochemical and subsequent structural defence responses initiated within 24 hours of inoculation by the most highly aggressive isolates. These responses were much faster on the less resistant and fastest on the susceptible check host, indicating that speed of recognition was correlated with resistance rating. This will inform fungicide application timing so that infected crops are sprayed with prophylactic chemistries prior to invasion and with systemic chemistries after the pathogen has invaded.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, a large diversity in aggressiveness exists. In an effort to better understand the risk from selective adaptation to currently used resistance sources and chemical control strategies, the population was examined in detail. For this, a total of 598 isolates were quasi-hierarchically sampled between 2013 and 2015 across all major Australian chickpea growing regions and commonly grown host genotypes. Although a large number of haplotypes were identified (66) through short sequence repeat (SSR) genotyping, overall low gene diversity (Hexp = 0.066) and genotypic diversity (D = 0.57) was detected. Almost 70\% of the isolates assessed were of a single dominant haplotype (ARH01). Disease screening on a differential host set, including three commonly deployed resistance sources, revealed distinct aggressiveness among the isolates, with 17\% of all isolates identified as highly aggressive. Almost 75\% of these were of the ARH01 haplotype. A similar pattern was observed at the host level, with 46\% of all isolates collected from the commonly grown host genotype Genesis090 (classified as ``resistant'' during the term of collection) identified as highly aggressive. Of these, 63\% belonged to the ARH01 haplotype. In conclusion, the ARH01 haplotype represents a significant risk to the Australian chickpea industry, being not only widely adapted to the diverse agro-geographical environments of the Australian chickpea growing regions, but also containing a disproportionately large number of aggressive isolates, indicating fitness to survive and replicate on the best resistance sources in the Australian germplasm.},
